# This script is designed to run in an existing git repo that
# might have some changes (either staged or unstaged).

# This script should take the recent changes to the repo,
# and move them all 1 step back.

# Head should become the previous commit
# What was last commit before the script was run should become staged changes to head
# What changes were staged before the script was run should become unstaged
# Any unstaged changes before the script was run should be stashed

# ~/git/testRepo % git status On branch master
# Changes to be committed: (use â€œgit reset HEAD ..." to unstage)

# use it like this
# ./oneStepBack

git stash #push tracked files onto stack
git stash -u #push untracked files onto stack
#current stash: 
#stash@{0}: untracked files
#stash@{1}: tracked files
git stash pop stash@{1} #get the tracked files
git reset . #copy current directory to head
git add . #stage current directory
git stash pop #apply stash and drop untracked files from stack
